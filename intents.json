				"Sure! Let me tell you about Christmas carols!\n\nCarols were first sung in Europe thousands of years ago, but these were not Christmas Carols. They were pre-Christian/pagan songs, sung at the Winter Solstice \nelebrations. The Winter Solstice is the shortest day of the year, usually taking place around 22nd December. The word Carol actually means a dance or a song of \nraise and joy! Carols used to be written and sung during all four seasons, but only the tradition of singing them at Christmas has really survived.\n\nChristmas, remembering the birth of Jesus, then started to be celebrated at the same time as the solstice, so the early Christians started singing Christian songs instead \nf pre-Christian/pagan ones. In 129, a Roman Bishop said that a song called 'Angel's Hymn' should be sung at a Christmas service in Rome. Another famous early \nhristmas Hymn was written in 760, by Comas of Jerusalem, for the Greek Orthodox Church. Soon after this many composers all over Europe started to write 'Christmas \narols'. However, not many people liked them as they were all written and sung in Latin, a language that the normal people couldn't understand.\n\nThis was changed by St. Francis of Assisi when, in 1223, he started his Nativity Plays in Italy. The people in the plays sang songs or 'canticles' that told the story \nuring the plays. Sometimes, the choruses of these new carols were in Latin; but normally they were all in a language that the people watching the play could \nnderstand and join in! The new carols spread to France, Spain, Germany and other European countries.\n\nThe earliest carol, like this, was written in 1410. Sadly only a very small fragment of it still exists. The carol was about Mary and Jesus meeting different people in \nethlehem. Most Carols from this time and the Elizabethan period are untrue stories, very loosely based on the Christmas story, about the holy family and were seen \ns entertaining rather than religious songs. They were usually sung in homes rather than in churches! Traveling singers or Minstrels started singing these carols \nnd the words were changed for the local people wherever they were traveling. One carols that changed like this is 'I Saw Three Ships'.\n\nWhen the Puritans came to power in England in 1640s, the celebration of Christmas and singing carols was stopped. However, the carols survived as people still sang them in \necret.\n\nUntil 1700 only the Psalms (poems from the Bible) were allowed to be sung in Anglican churches (Churches in the Church of England). From 1700, and for many years, the only \nhristmas song (or carol) which was allowed in Anglican churches was 'While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks By Night' because its lyrics come from the Bible, \nelling the story of the Shepherds visiting the baby Jesus. During this time, many churches had musicians from the local area play the music for them and often \nocal tunes were used for the songs. Because of this, 'While Shepherds Watched' is probably the carol sung to the most number of different tunes!\n\nIn 1739 Charles Wesley wrote 'A Hymn for Christmas-Day' with the first line 'Hark how all the Welkin Rings'. This became 'Hark the Herald Angels Sing' in 1754 when it was \ndapted for a 'Collection of Hymns for Social Worship'. However, the tune that we sing it to now was written by the composer Mendelssohn in 1840, which was adapted \nn 1855 with Wesley's words being set to it. (Wesley had thought his new Christmas hymn would be sung to the same tune as the Easter hymn 'Christ the Lord is Risen \noday'.)\n\nCarols remained mainly unsung, especially in churches, until Victorian times, when two men called William Sandys and Davis Gilbert collected lots of old Christmas music \nrom villages in England. Carols were stilling being sung as folk songs in places like pubs but they often weren't thought of as 'proper' or 'nice' songs by the \niddle or upper classes. (Singing carols in pubs still happens today and there's some very famous carol singing in pubs in the north of England, especially in \north Derbyshire and South Yorkshire.)\n\nBefore carol singing in places like churches became popular, there were sometimes official carol singers called 'Waits'. These were bands of people led by important local \neaders (such as council leaders) who had the only power in the towns and villages to take money from the public (if others did this, they were sometimes charged \ns beggars!). They were called 'Waits' because they sang on Christmas Eve (This was sometimes known as 'watchnight' or 'waitnight' because of the shepherds were \natching their sheep when the angels appeared to them.), when the Christmas celebrations began.\n\nAlso, during the Victorian period, many orchestras and choirs were being set up in the cities of England and people wanted Christmas songs to sing, so carols once again \necame popular in churches and concert halls. Many new carols, such as 'Good King Wenceslas', were also written in the Victorian period.\n\nNew carols services were created and became popular, as did the custom of singing carols in the streets. Both of these customs are still popular today! One of the most \nopular types of Carols services are Carols by Candlelight services. At this service, the church is only lit by candlelight and it feels very Christmassy! Carols \ny Candlelight services are held in countries all over the world.\n\nThe most famous type of Carol Service might be a Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, where carols and Bible readings tell the Christmas Story."

				"Christmas is a holiday celebrated by people worldwide to remember the birth of Jesus Christ, whom Christians believe is the Son of God. The word 'Christmas' comes from 'Christ-Mass,' a special church service where Christians remember Jesus's death and resurrection. Christmas is a time for family and friends to come together and exchange gifts.\nThe exact date of Jesus's birth is unknown, and the early Christians debated when to celebrate it. The first recorded celebration of Christmas on December 25th was in 336 AD during the time of the Roman Emperor Constantine. However, there are various theories about why this date was chosen.\nOne early Christian tradition said that Jesus was conceived on March 25th and that Christmas was celebrated nine months later on December 25th. March 25th was also believed to be the day of creation and the day of Jesus's death. These dates were based on different calendars, including the lunar Jewish calendar, making them movable.\nThe idea that Jesus's conception occurred on March 25th was proposed by an early church historian, Sextus Julius Africanus, around 221 AD, though it's based on later documents. Saint Ephrem the Syrian suggested a different date, Nisan 10, for Jesus's conception. Nevertheless, March 25th became a fixed date to mark the moveable events in the Jewish calendar."

				"Advent is a period of four Sundays and weeks leading up to Christmas, usually starting on the 1st of December and ending on Christmas Eve. The word 'Advent' comes from the Latin word for 'Coming' and signifies the coming of Jesus into the world. Christians use this time to prepare for and reflect on the true meaning of Christmas.\nDuring Advent, Christians focus on three aspects of Jesus's coming. The first is his historical birth as a baby about 2,000 years ago. The second aspect is his presence in our lives today, and the third is his future return as King and Judge.\nAdvent Sunday varies in date, starting from November 27th (the longest Advent) to December 3rd (the shortest Advent). Depending on when it starts, Advent can last between 22 and 28 days. However, Advent always lasts for 24 days when Christmas Day falls on a Wednesday.\nThe origin of Advent dates back to at least 567 when monks were ordered to fast during December as a way of preparing for Christmas. Some people still fast during Advent to help them focus on the significance of Jesus's coming.\nIn various Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, Advent is known as the Nativity Fast or Winter Lent and can last for 40 days. The starting date for this fast varies depending on the date of Christmas celebration in different traditions."

				"The 12 Days of Christmas begin on Christmas Day and end on the evening of January 5th, known as Twelfth Night. They have been celebrated in Europe since before the Middle Ages as a time of joy and festivity. Contrary to common belief, these 12 days are not the days leading up to Christmas; that time is called Advent.\nThe 12 Days of Christmas were established in 567 at the Council of Tours to harmonize the different Christmas celebration dates of the Western and Eastern Christian churches. The Western Church celebrated Christmas on December 25th, while the Eastern Church celebrated it on January 6th, also known as Epiphany.\nEach of the 12 days traditionally commemorates a feast day for a saint or has unique celebrations associated with it. For instance, Day 1 is Christmas Day, celebrating the birth of Jesus. Day 2 is St. Stephen's Day, honoring the first Christian martyr. These days have different customs and may vary in different countries and regions."

				"Epiphany is celebrated 12 days after Christmas on 6th January (or January 19th for some Orthodox Church who have Christmas on 7th January) and is the time when Christians remember the Wise Men (also sometimes called the Three Kings) who visited Jesus. The Bible doesn't say how many Wise Men there were or that they were kings. The number three comes from the three gifts the Wise Men / Magi brought with them.\nEpiphany is also when some Churches remember when Jesus was Baptised, when he was about 30, and started to teach people about God. Epiphany means 'revelation' and both the visit of the Wise Men and his Baptism are important times when Jesus was 'revealed' to be very important.\nSome Churches celebrate use Epiphany to celebrate and remember both the visit of the Wise Men and Jesus's Baptism! Epiphany is mainly celebrated by Catholics and Orthodox Christians.\nIn Orthodox churches, Epiphany is also known as 'The Feast of the Holy Theophany' and it is as important as Christmas. During the services to celebrate Epiphany, on the eve of the feast and on the feast day, water is blessed (some churches only bless water at one service). This is to remember Jesus's baptism. The blessed water is used in church services during the rest of the year. People are often baptised on the Feast of the Holy Theophany. After the service, the water is also used by a priest to bless the houses of people in the church. It can sometimes take days or even weeks for the priest to visit all the houses and bless them."

				"Christmas is sometimes called Xmas, and some people believe it removes the 'Christ' from Christmas. However, the 'X' in Xmas actually represents the Greek letter chi (Χ), which is the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Christos. Early Christians used the chi and rho (ΧΡ) to create a symbol for Jesus. The fish symbol was also used by early Christians, representing Jesus' call to make his followers 'Fishers of Men.' So, Xmas can be seen as a legitimate abbreviation for Christmas, with the 'X' symbolizing Christ, and it should be pronounced as 'Christmas' rather than 'ex-mas."

In some churches, the first Christmas service begins on Christmas Eve after sunset, marked by the ringing of bells. In the UK, it's customary to ring the largest bell four times in the hour before midnight and then ring all the bells at midnight.\nThe Catholic Church permits Mass at midnight on Christmas, reflecting the belief that Jesus was born at this time, although this isn't proven. Many churches hold midnight services on Christmas Eve. In some Catholic countries, such as France, Spain, and Italy, attending the midnight Mass is a significant tradition.\n'Jingle Bells,' now a beloved Christmas song, was originally called 'One Horse Open Sleigh' and written as a Thanksgiving song in 1857. However, it became associated with Christmas due to its wintry lyrics. The song was first recorded in 1889, and it's famous for being the first song broadcast from space in 1965 by astronauts Tom Stafford and Wally Schirra. It was composed by James Lord Pierpont, with its origins debated between Massachusetts in 1850 and Savannah, Georgia around 1875."

The term 'candy canes' was first used in 1866, and they became associated with Christmas in 1874. Originally with a simple sugar flavor, they are now commonly flavored with peppermint or wintergreen.\nAround 1920, Bob McCormack from Georgia began making candy canes, leading to his company, Bob's Candies. His brother-in-law, a Catholic priest named Gregory Harding Keller, invented the 'Keller Machine' for automatic cane shaping. Despite being acquired in 2005, Bob's Candies still produces candy canes.\nA charming, likely untrue, story suggests a German choirmaster in 1670 created the candy cane to keep children quiet during a Christmas nativity service, shaping them like a 'J' for a shepherd's crook.\nSome ascribe Christian meanings to candy canes, such as the 'J' representing Jesus, white for Christ's purity, and red stripes for his blood on the cross. These meanings were added later. Candy canes are often seen in Christmas stockings."

				"Evergreen trees (and other evergreen plants) have traditionally been used to celebrate winter festivals (pre-Christian/pagan and Christian) for thousands of years. Pre-Christian/Pagans used branches of evergreen trees to decorate their homes during the winter solstice, as it made them think of the spring to come. The Romans used Fir Trees to decorate their temples at the festival of Saturnalia. However, they were quite different to what we now think of as Christmas Trees.\n\nNobody is really sure when Fir trees were first used as Christmas trees. It probably began about 1000 years ago in Northern Europe.\n\nChristmas Trees might well have started out as 'Paradise Trees' (branches or wooden frames decorated with apples). These were used in medieval German Mystery or Miracle Plays that were acted out in front of Churches during Advent and on Christmas Eve. In early church calendars of saints, 24th December was Adam and Eve's day. The Paradise Tree represented the Garden of Eden. It was often paraded around the town before the play started, as a way of advertising the play. The plays told Bible stories to people who could not read.\n\nChristmas Trees as they came to be now started around the late 1400s into the 1500s. In what's now Germany (was the Holy Roman Empire then), the Paradise Tree had more decorations on it (sometimes communion wafers, cherries and later pastry decorations of stars, bells, angels, etc. were added) and it even got a new nickname the 'Christbaum' or 'Christ Tree'.\n\nSome early Christmas Trees, across many parts of northern Europe, were cherry or hawthorn plants (or a branch of the plant) that were put into pots and brought inside so they would hopefully flower at Christmas time. If you couldn't afford a real plant, people made pyramids of woods and they were decorated to look like a tree with paper, apples and candles. It's possible that the wooden pyramid trees were meant to be like Paradise Trees. Sometimes they were carried around from house to house, rather than being displayed in a home.\n\nSome trees (or at least small tops of them or branches of fir trees) were hung from the ceiling, mainly in some parts of Germany, some Slavic countries and parts of Poland. This might have been to save space or they just looked nice hanging from the rafters! (If you have lighting hooks on the ceiling, they would also be an obvious place to hang things from.)"

Couples engage in walks, admiring Christmas lights, and share romantic meals. Fried chicken, notably from KFC, is a common Christmas meal inspired by a successful 1974 advertising campaign. While not a national holiday, schools may close around Christmas Day, aligning with the start of the New Year school break. \n\nUnique Christmas traditions in Japan include the widespread popularity of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, known as 'daiku,' sung by choirs across the country. Additionally, Tokyo Disneyland attracts visitors during the Christmas season with festive decorations and parades. The Japanese New Year, 'o shogatsu,' is a family-focused celebration lasting from December 31st to January 4th, contrasting with the festive and romantic atmosphere of Christmas in Japan."

Christmas parties are gaining traction among young city dwellers, resembling Valentine's Day celebrations with the exchange of gifts. \n\nThe Mandarin greeting 'Sheng Dan Kuai Le' and Cantonese equivalent 'Seng Dan Fai Lok' mark the Christmas festivities in China. While Christmas Trees are not widespread, those who have them often opt for plastic ones adorned with paper chains, flowers, and lanterns. Interestingly, China manufactures a significant portion of the world's plastic Christmas Trees and decorations, despite these items not being prevalent in the homes of the producers. A unique tradition involves giving apples on Christmas Eve, as the Mandarin word for apple, (píngguǒ) sounds like the word for peace. Additionally, some engage in carol singing, with (Jingle Bells) being a popular Christmas song in China. \n\nWhile Christmas may not hold religious significance for many in China, the festive atmosphere, decorations, and emerging traditions contribute to the celebration of this holiday in urban areas, especially among the younger generation."

				"The color blue is often associated with Mary, the mother of Jesus. In medieval times blue dye and paint was more expensive than gold! So it would only be worn by Royal families and very rich people. Mary was often painted wearing blue to show she was very important.\n\nBlue can also represent the color of the sky and heaven."

				"One of the main reasons we have the custom of giving and receiving presents at Christmas, is to remind us of the presents given to Jesus by the Wise Men: Frankincense, Gold and Myrrh.\n\n\n\tGold: is associated with Kings and Christians believe that Jesus is the King of Kings.\n\n\tFrankincense: is sometimes used in worship in Churches and showed that people would worship Jesus.\n\n\tMyrrh: is a perfume that is put on dead bodies to make them smell nice; Christian believe that it showed that Jesus would suffer and die.\n\n\nChristmas itself is really about a big present that God gave the world about 2000 years ago - Jesus! One of the most famous Bible verses, John 3:16, says: 'God loved the world so much, that he gave his one and only Son, so that whoever believes in him may not be lost but have eternal life.'.\n\nAll over the world, families and friends give presents to each other. Most children around the world believe in a Christmas gift bringer. It's often St. Nicholas, Santa Claus or Father Christmas, but in parts of Germany they believe that it is the Christkind, in Spain they believe it is the Wise Men and in parts of Italy they believe it is an old lady called Befana."

				"Snowmen were probably first made by people to scare away evil winter spirits. But now they are just a good excuse to have lots of fun in the snow! (If you know anything about why snowmen were first built, please let me know!)\n\nProbably the most famous snowman is 'Frosty the Snowman' who appears in a Christmas song of the same name. The song was written in 1950 by Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins. It was recorded in 1953 by the American singer Perry Como and became very popular. A film called Frosty the Snowman was made in 1969 and told the story of a magical snowman who came to life and became best friends with a little girl. Sing along to 'Frosty the Snowman' (on a different site).\n\nIn the UK there is a famous animated film called The Snowman (made in 1982) about a snowman who comes to life and takes a little boy flying of to see Father Christmas. We used to watch it every year when I was in Primary (Elementary) School on the last school day before the Christmas holidays! The cartoon has a song in it called {We're Walking in the Air}. It was made famous when it was released as a single in 1985 and sung by a choir boy called Aled Jones. Aled is now an adult and a popular television and radio presenter in the UK! (In the original animation, the song was sung by a choir boy called Peter Auty.)"
