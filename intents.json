				"Christmas is a holiday celebrated by people worldwide to remember the birth of Jesus Christ, whom Christians believe is the Son of God. The word 'Christmas' comes from 'Christ-Mass,' a special church service where Christians remember Jesus's death and resurrection. Christmas is a time for family and friends to come together and exchange gifts.\nThe exact date of Jesus's birth is unknown, and the early Christians debated when to celebrate it. The first recorded celebration of Christmas on December 25th was in 336 AD during the time of the Roman Emperor Constantine. However, there are various theories about why this date was chosen.\nOne early Christian tradition said that Jesus was conceived on March 25th and that Christmas was celebrated nine months later on December 25th. March 25th was also believed to be the day of creation and the day of Jesus's death. These dates were based on different calendars, including the lunar Jewish calendar, making them movable.\nThe idea that Jesus's conception occurred on March 25th was proposed by an early church historian, Sextus Julius Africanus, around 221 AD, though it's based on later documents. Saint Ephrem the Syrian suggested a different date, Nisan 10, for Jesus's conception. Nevertheless, March 25th became a fixed date to mark the moveable events in the Jewish calendar."

				"Christmas is sometimes called Xmas, and some people believe it removes the 'Christ' from Christmas. However, the 'X' in Xmas actually represents the Greek letter chi (Χ), which is the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Christos. Early Christians used the chi and rho (ΧΡ) to create a symbol for Jesus. The fish symbol was also used by early Christians, representing Jesus' call to make his followers 'Fishers of Men.' So, Xmas can be seen as a legitimate abbreviation for Christmas, with the 'X' symbolizing Christ, and it should be pronounced as 'Christmas' rather than 'ex-mas."

				"Bells, especially church bells, have a strong connection to Christmas traditions. In some churches, the first Christmas service begins on Christmas Eve after sunset, marked by the ringing of bells. In the UK, it's customary to ring the largest bell four times in the hour before midnight and then ring all the bells at midnight.\nThe Catholic Church permits Mass at midnight on Christmas, reflecting the belief that Jesus was born at this time, although this isn't proven. Many churches hold midnight services on Christmas Eve. In some Catholic countries, such as France, Spain, and Italy, attending the midnight Mass is a significant tradition.\n'Jingle Bells,' now a beloved Christmas song, was originally called 'One Horse Open Sleigh' and written as a Thanksgiving song in 1857. However, it became associated with Christmas due to its wintry lyrics. The song was first recorded in 1889, and it's famous for being the first song broadcast from space in 1965 by astronauts Tom Stafford and Wally Schirra. It was composed by James Lord Pierpont, with its origins debated between Massachusetts in 1850 and Savannah, Georgia around 1875."

				"Candy canes originated in 1837 as straight white sugar sticks, gaining red stripes a few years later. The term 'candy canes' was first used in 1866, and they became associated with Christmas in 1874. Originally with a simple sugar flavor, they are now commonly flavored with peppermint or wintergreen.\nAround 1920, Bob McCormack from Georgia began making candy canes, leading to his company, Bob's Candies. His brother-in-law, a Catholic priest named Gregory Harding Keller, invented the 'Keller Machine' for automatic cane shaping. Despite being acquired in 2005, Bob's Candies still produces candy canes.\nA charming, likely untrue, story suggests a German choirmaster in 1670 created the candy cane to keep children quiet during a Christmas nativity service, shaping them like a 'J' for a shepherd's crook.\nSome ascribe Christian meanings to candy canes, such as the 'J' representing Jesus, white for Christ's purity, and red stripes for his blood on the cross. These meanings were added later. Candy canes are often seen in Christmas stockings."

				"Evergreen trees (and other evergreen plants) have traditionally been used to celebrate winter festivals (pre-Christian/pagan and Christian) for thousands of years. Pre-Christian/Pagans used branches of evergreen trees to decorate their homes during the winter solstice, as it made them think of the spring to come. The Romans used Fir Trees to decorate their temples at the festival of Saturnalia. However, they were quite different to what we now think of as Christmas Trees.\n\nNobody is really sure when Fir trees were first used as Christmas trees. It probably began about 1000 years ago in Northern Europe.\n\nChristmas Trees might well have started out as 'Paradise Trees' (branches or wooden frames decorated with apples). These were used in medieval German Mystery or Miracle Plays that were acted out in front of Churches during Advent and on Christmas Eve. In early church calendars of saints, 24th December was Adam and Eve's day. The Paradise Tree represented the Garden of Eden. It was often paraded around the town before the play started, as a way of advertising the play. The plays told Bible stories to people who could not read.\n\nChristmas Trees as they came to be now started around the late 1400s into the 1500s. In what's now Germany (was the Holy Roman Empire then), the Paradise Tree had more decorations on it (sometimes communion wafers, cherries and later pastry decorations of stars, bells, angels, etc. were added) and it even got a new nickname the 'Christbaum' or 'Christ Tree'.\n\nSome early Christmas Trees, across many parts of northern Europe, were cherry or hawthorn plants (or a branch of the plant) that were put into pots and brought inside so they would hopefully flower at Christmas time. If you couldn't afford a real plant, people made pyramids of woods and they were decorated to look like a tree with paper, apples and candles. It's possible that the wooden pyramid trees were meant to be like Paradise Trees. Sometimes they were carried around from house to house, rather than being displayed in a home.\n\nSome trees (or at least small tops of them or branches of fir trees) were hung from the ceiling, mainly in some parts of Germany, some Slavic countries and parts of Poland. This might have been to save space or they just looked nice hanging from the rafters! (If you have lighting hooks on the ceiling, they would also be an obvious place to hang things from.)"

The ancient Egyptians used to bring palm branches into their houses during the mid winter festivals.\n\nIn many parts of Europe during the middle ages, Paradise plays were performed, often on Christmas Eve. They told Bible stories to people who couldn't read. The 'Paradise Tree' in the garden of eden in the play was normally a pine tree with red apples tied to it.\n\nNow the most common use of green at Christmas are Christmas Trees."

				"Well, one of the main reasons we have the custom of giving and receiving presents at Christmas, is to remind us of the presents given to Jesus by the Wise Men: Frankincense, Gold and Myrrh.\n\n\n\tGold: is associated with Kings and Christians believe that Jesus is the King of Kings.\n\n\tFrankincense: is sometimes used in worship in Churches and showed that people would worship Jesus.\n\n\tMyrrh: is a perfume that is put on dead bodies to make them smell nice; Christian believe that it showed that Jesus would suffer and die.\n\n\nChristmas itself is really about a big present that God gave the world about 2000 years ago - Jesus! One of the most famous Bible verses, John 3:16, says: 'God loved the world so much, that he gave his one and only Son, so that whoever believes in him may not be lost but have eternal life.'.\n\nAll over the world, families and friends give presents to each other. Most children around the world believe in a Christmas gift bringer. It's often St. Nicholas, Santa Claus or Father Christmas, but in parts of Germany they believe that it is the Christkind, in Spain they believe it is the Wise Men and in parts of Italy they believe it is an old lady called Befana."

				"Snowmen were probably first made by people to scare away evil winter spirits. But now they are just a good excuse to have lots of fun in the snow! (If you know anything about why snowmen were first built, please let me know!)\n\nProbably the most famous snowman is 'Frosty the Snowman' who appears in a Christmas song of the same name. The song was written in 1950 by Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins. It was recorded in 1953 by the American singer Perry Como and became very popular. A film called Frosty the Snowman was made in 1969 and told the story of a magical snowman who came to life and became best friends with a little girl. Sing along to 'Frosty the Snowman' (on a different site).\n\nIn the UK there is a famous animated film called The Snowman (made in 1982) about a snowman who comes to life and takes a little boy flying of to see Father Christmas. We used to watch it every year when I was in Primary (Elementary) School on the last school day before the Christmas holidays! The cartoon has a song in it called {We're Walking in the Air}. It was made famous when it was released as a single in 1985 and sung by a choir boy called Aled Jones. Aled is now an adult and a popular television and radio presenter in the UK! (In the original animation, the song was sung by a choir boy called Peter Auty.)"
